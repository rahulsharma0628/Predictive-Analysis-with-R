Modeling
=
I have employed the two models of decision trees namely CART and C5.0. The results of the models are as follows:<br>

<b>CART Model:</b><br>
Accuracy = 0.644<br>
Precision = 0.599<br>
Recall = 0.414<br>

<b>C5.0 Model:</b><br>
Accuracy = 0.65973<br>
Precision = 0.595<br>
Recall = 0.4<br>
